                <hr>
                <p class="text-muted text-left">Dr. Gyl Kasewurm of Professional Hearing Services has combined her expertise with an understanding of how to serve a unique population during these unprecedented times.

                    As a supporter of the Lakeshore Excellence Foundation (LEF) and one of LEF’s recent “Distinguished Alumni” award recipients, Dr. Kasewurm contacted Lakeshore Excellence Foundation Chairman, J.C. Anderson, with the idea of helping students and staff who may be having difficulties wearing traditional masks in school.

                    “These masks feature a plastic window enabling the students to see the teacher’s mouth. Facial expressions communicate a wide variety of emotions and when you can see the lips, it takes less effort to communicate. They really benefit everyone,” said Dr. Kasewurm.

                    J.C. Anderson, LEF Chairman, says that Dr. Kasewurm, a Lakeshore graduate, “has been a gracious advocate and a Lancer Leader since day one. We appreciate Gyl’s generous donation.”
